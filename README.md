# Shipping-Calculator

Calculates the volume and shipping cost of two packages and compares the prices.

## Objective

This assignment basically tested our ability to implement pseudo-code.

## Requirements

1. The program must ask for two separate packages to ship
2. The program must calculate the cost difference using the difference in volume. 
The base price for a package with volume <=1 is $3, 
for every unit increase in volume, the cost increases by $1.
3.	The program must indicate the more costly package (if not same cost) and by how much.
    - If there is no difference, display the costs as the same  
    - If the cost of one is less than twice the other, display that it is “slightly more than”  
    - If the cost of one is less than three times the other, display that it is “twice”  
    - If the cost of one is less than four times the other, display that it is “triple”  
    - If the cost of one is less than five times the other, display that it is “quadruple”  
    - Otherwise, display that as a calculated multiple
  
4.	The program must calculate and display the appropriate message (including proper dimension and cost format).
5.	Your code also does NOT (YET) need to worry if the user inputs an invalid value for the input (example: invalid length).
